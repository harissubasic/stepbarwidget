# Step Bar custom widget
Step Bar custom widget for Bonita UI Designer
It allows you to show progress based on milestones that you define. It can be used in a form or in a page, for example to show the end user in which phase or milestone the process instance is currentlly at.
There are two properties to configure:
## Step List
It is a comma-separated list of text value that will show up as milestones (steps).
## Current step
Name of the step (or milestone) that you want to highlight as current. It must correspond to one of the values from the Step List, otherwise no step will be highlighted as current.
